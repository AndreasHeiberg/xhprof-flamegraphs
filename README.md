# XHProf FlameGraphs

A script to convert a directory of xhprof sampling files to a format that can be read by Brendan Gregg's [FlameGraph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph) script.

Note: This works with files generated by xhprof_sample_enable/xhprof_sample_disable. It will not work with the more common hierarchical xhprof format.

# Usage

First, generate the sampling data, writing the files with a "sample_xhprof" file extension. Then run the script passing the directory containing those files as an argument like so:

```
./xhprof-sample-to-flamegraph-stacks /directory/with/sample/xhprof/files | flamegraph.pl > xhprof-flamegraph.svg
```
